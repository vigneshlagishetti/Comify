# Comify ‚Äî Company Registration & Dashboard

Comify is a full-stack company registration, profile management, and employer dashboard application. It combines a React + Vite frontend with Supabase/Postgres backend patterns and includes features such as multi-step company registration, job posting dashboard, company profiles, and admin-style management views.

## What‚Äôs implemented (detailed)

Note: I inspected and documented the current working components. If you add new files later, update this README accordingly.

- Frontend pages/components (key files)
   - `src/components/JobpilotDashboard.jsx` ‚Äî Full employer dashboard UI and navigation (renamed branding to Comify in UI). Contains sections:
      - Overview: welcome, stats grid, charts (mock)
      - Employers Profile: company header, stats, activity timeline, company form (edit)
      - Post a Job: comprehensive job posting form
      - My Jobs: card-based job listings with actions
      - Saved Candidates: saved candidates list
      - Plans & Billing: billing UI scaffold (usage, history)
      - All Companies: company directory cards
      - Settings: multi-tab settings area
   - `src/components/CompanyRegistrationForm.jsx` ‚Äî Multi-step company registration form (4 steps: company info, address, additional info, logo/banner upload). Uses Zod validation and uploads to Cloudinary.
   - `src/components/LandingPage.jsx` ‚Äî Marketing home page and CTA flows. Routes users to registration or dashboard based on sign-in and company registration status.
   - `src/components/JobpilotRegister.jsx`, `src/components/JobpilotComplete.jsx` (and simple variants) ‚Äî Alternate registration interfaces and completion flows for onboarding.
   - `src/components/auth/*` ‚Äî Authentication components (Register, Clerk integration wrappers).
   - `src/components/company/CompanyProfile.jsx` ‚Äî Company profile viewer used in dashboard and landing flow.
   - `src/components/dashboard/Dashboard.jsx` ‚Äî Additional dashboard utilities and stubbed admin views.

- Utilities & config
   - `index.html` ‚Äî App title changed to Comify
   - `.gitignore` ‚Äî Updated to include standard Node/Tailwind/Vite ignores and project-specific cache files
   - `.vscode/settings.json` ‚Äî Workspace association for SQL -> Postgres (optional)

- DB schema
   - `supabase_schema_clerk.sql` ‚Äî PostgreSQL schema for `users` and `company_profile` with triggers, indexes and a view. NOTE: This file is valid PostgreSQL but may show lint errors in VS Code if language mode isn't set to PostgreSQL.

## Running locally

Follow these steps to run the project locally (frontend + Supabase patterns described):

1) Clone repo and install

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd Brahmaiah_Project/frontend
npm install
```

2) Environment variables (create `.env` in `frontend/`)

Create `frontend/.env` and add:

```env
# Clerk (if using Clerk integration)
VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key

# Supabase (if using Supabase patterns)
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-supabase-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key

# Cloudinary for image uploads
VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=your_upload_preset

# Other optional settings
NODE_ENV=development
```

3) Run the frontend development server

```bash
# from frontend/
npm run dev
```

The app serves on the port Vite assigns (commonly `http://localhost:5173`), or `http://localhost:3000` depending on your config.

4) Local backend / Supabase

- If you use Supabase, create a Supabase project and run the SQL in `supabase_schema_clerk.sql` in the SQL editor.
- If you run a local backend, point the frontend to the local API via env vars and start it in `backend/` (if present).

## Environment variables (summary)

- `VITE_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` ‚Äî Clerk public key (if using Clerk)
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` ‚Äî Supabase project URL
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` ‚Äî Supabase anon key
- `VITE_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME` ‚Äî Cloudinary cloud name
- `VITE_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET` ‚Äî Cloudinary upload preset (unsigned)

## Database & schema

- Run `supabase_schema_clerk.sql` in Supabase SQL editor. It contains:
   - `users` table (UUID PK, clerk_id, email, full_name, mobile_no, gender, timestamps)
   - `company_profile` table (UUID PK, owner_id FK -> users, company details, verification_status, timestamps)
   - `update_updated_at_column()` trigger function and triggers
   - Indexes and a view `company_profiles_with_users`

Note: If VS Code shows lint errors for `supabase_schema_clerk.sql`, change the language mode to **PostgreSQL** (bottom-right in VS Code) or install a PostgreSQL extension like `ms-ossdata.vscode-pgsql`.

## Routes / Endpoints (frontend interactions)

- Landing page checks company profile: `GET /api/company-profile/:userId` (this route is used by landing and may 404 if backend not running)
- Job posting and company profile operations are currently implemented in the frontend with mock data or via Supabase REST endpoints if you configured Supabase.

## Troubleshooting

- If dashboard navigation shows only the Settings tab and content doesn't load, check console/network for failed API calls. Landing page and dashboard expect `GET /api/company-profile/:userId`. If your backend is not running, the frontend will fall back to mock data in many places but some flows expect the API.
- SQL linting errors in editors: set file language to PostgreSQL to stop incorrect SQL Server parsing errors.
- If file rename commands fail in PowerShell, use:

```powershell
# PowerShell rename
Rename-Item -Path .\supabase_schema_clerk.sql -NewName supabase_schema_clerk.pgsql
```

## Next steps & TODOs

- Complete Saved Candidates UI and interactions
- Implement full Plans & Billing backend integration
- Hook My Jobs and Job posting to a persistent backend (Supabase or custom API)
- Add unit and E2E tests

---

If you want, I can also:

- Add a smaller `README-frontend.md` inside `frontend/` with exact npm commands and environment variable examples
- Generate a basic `docker-compose.yml` to run a local Postgres + Adminer for local development

Tell me which of those you'd like next and I‚Äôll add it.
